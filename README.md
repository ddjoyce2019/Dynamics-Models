# Dynamics-Models
Manipulating objects with a robot arm is fundamentally governed by Newtonian Physics.
However, obtaining an exact analytical model is impossible due to numerous parameters that
cannot be fully observed, making data-driven learning approaches a natural solution. Unlike
model-free methods that directly predict robot actions, dynamics models offer the ability to
predict the future state of a system based on given actions. This predictive capability presents
significant advantages, notably the ease of generalizing an existing dynamics model to various
tasks without necessitating retraining.The recent rapid advancements in world modeling,
especially OpenAI's Sora, have significantly heightened interest in this research area.
